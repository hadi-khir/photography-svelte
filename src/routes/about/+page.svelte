		<p class="mb-4">
			Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm <span class="font-bold">Hadi</span>, a passionate
			software engineer with a love for creating things that not only function seamlessly but also
			bring joy and beauty into the world. Photography has been a personal passion of mine, and this
			site is my canvas for showcasing my favorite moments captured through the lens.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why This Site?</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			In a world dominated by social media, I felt the need for a space that goes beyond the
			fleeting scrolls and constant updates. This site is my answer to that, a dedicated platform
			where I can curate and present my cherished photographs in a more meaningful and intentional
			way.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Capturing Moments, Building Memories</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			Photography, to me, is more than just a hobby - it's a way to freeze time, encapsulating the
			beauty of a moment in a single frame. This site is a reflection of my journey, a visual
			narrative of the places I've been, the people I've met, and the emotions I've experienced.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who Am I?</h2>

		<p class="mb-4">
			As mentioned, I'm a software engineer by day, crafting elegant solutions to complex problems.
			But when the workday concludes, I don the hat of a photographer, seeking to find the
			extraordinary in the ordinary and immortalize it through my lens.
		</p>
